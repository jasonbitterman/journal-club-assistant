## A Randomized Trial of Intraarterial Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke

## Aim of Study
To determine whether intraarterial treatment plus usual care is more effective than usual care alone in improving functional outcomes among patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion in the anterior circulation, when intraarterial treatment can be initiated within 6 hours of symptom onset.

## Study Design
A pragmatic, phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with open-label treatment and blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design) conducted at 16 centers in the Netherlands.

## Intervention
Intraarterial treatment (which could involve intraarterial thrombolysis with alteplase or urokinase, mechanical thrombectomy, or both) in addition to usual care, compared to usual care alone. Usual care could include intravenous administration of alteplase. The choice of intraarterial method and device selection was left to the discretion of the local interventionist, provided the devices were approved by regulatory authorities and the trial's steering committee.

## Number of Subjects
- Intraarterial treatment group: 233 patients
- Control (usual care) group: 267 patients

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
### Main Inclusion Criteria:
- Patients ≥18 years (no upper age limit)
- Acute ischemic stroke due to a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion of the anterior circulation (distal intracranial carotid artery, M1/M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery, or A1/A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery) confirmed by CTA, MRA, or DSA
- NIHSS score ≥2 at baseline
- Intraarterial treatment possible within 6 hours of onset
- Inclusion of patients with additional extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion/dissection left to physician judgment

### Exclusion Criteria:
- Not specified in full in the body, referenced as detailed in the study protocol (not all details visible in main text). Patients who were screened for eligibility but not enrolled were not logged.

## Primary Outcome
Score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days post-randomization, analyzed as a shift across all categories using ordinal logistic regression. The mRS ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).

## Secondary Outcome
- NIHSS score at 24 hours and at 5–7 days or discharge
- Activities of daily living by the Barthel Index
- Quality of life by EQ-5D at 90 days
- Imaging outcomes: vessel recanalization at 24 h (by CTA/MRA), final infarct volume at 5–7 days (by CT)
- Dichotomized mRS (e.g., 0–1 vs. 2–6; 0–2 vs. 3–6)
- Safety: death, symptomatic ICH, other adverse events.

## Statistical Methods
- Ordinal logistic regression for mRS shift analysis, adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (age, NIHSS at baseline, time from stroke onset to randomization, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, ICA terminus occlusion)
- Secondary outcomes evaluated using odds ratios or beta coefficients as appropriate
- Subgroup and sensitivity analyses reported
- All primary and secondary analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.

## Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, including age (median 65–66 years), sex distribution (about 58% male), median NIHSS (17–18), vascular risk factors, stroke history, atrial fibrillation, and use of IV alteplase (~89% in both groups). No major or systematic differences at baseline between the groups were reported.

## Primary Outcome Results
There was a significant shift favoring the intervention group on the mRS at 90 days: adjusted common odds ratio 1.67 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.30; p<0.01), meaning a greater likelihood of a lower (better) mRS score with intraarterial therapy. The proportion of patients functionally independent (mRS 0–2 at 90 days) was 32.6% in the intervention group vs. 19.1% in the control group, with an absolute difference of 13.5 percentage points (95% CI, 5.9 to 21.2) and adjusted odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.39 to 3.38).

## Secondary Outcome Results
- Median NIHSS at 24h was 13 (intervention) vs. 16 (control); at 5–7 days was 8 (intervention) vs. 14 (control) — differences favoring intervention with adjusted betas of −2.3 and −2.9, respectively.
- Barthel Index (19–20 at 90 days): 46% (intervention) vs. 29.8% (control), odds ratio 2.1 (1.4–3.2).
- EQ-5D median at 90 days: 0.69 (intervention) vs. 0.66 (control), adjusted beta 0.06 (−0.01 to 0.13).
- Complete vessel recanalization at 24 h: 75.4% (intervention) vs. 32.9% (control), odds ratio ~6.3 (highly significant).
- Median final infarct volume: 49 ml (intervention) vs. 79 ml (control), adjusted beta −19 ml (−34 to −3).
- Mortality and symptomatic ICH showed no statistically significant differences, with mortality at 90 days nearly identical (18.9% vs. 18.4%). Rates of symptomatic new stroke in other territories slightly higher in intervention group (5.6% vs. 0.4%).

## Analysis
The trial is robustly designed, with central randomization, clearly defined eligibility criteria, and blinded outcome assessment, minimizing the risk of bias. The use of intention-to-treat analysis bolsters the validity of the findings. Baseline characteristics are well-balanced, which further supports unbiased treatment comparisons. Primary and secondary outcomes are consistent and demonstrate both statistical and probable clinical significance of intraarterial treatment in improving outcomes among patients with major anterior circulation stroke, with substantial improvements in functional independence and radiological surrogates. The negative findings for mortality and symptomatic hemorrhage provide additional reassurance about safety.

However, several weaknesses need to be carefully considered. First, the open-label nature of the treatment could, despite blinded outcome assessment, still introduce some bias (especially for subjective measures like mRS if unblinding occurred). Second, the lack of detail on the precise exclusion criteria in the primary text, and the absence of a screening log, limit assessment for selection bias. The pragmatic eligibility means the findings are generalizable, but the high proportion of patients treated with IV alteplase (~89%) might make the trial less applicable to those not eligible for alteplase, or in systems where IVT is less available. Procedure-related complications (especially embolization to new territories) were nontrivial in the intervention group, and longer-term safety is not addressed. Completion of follow-up was high, but ~16% of patients allocated to intervention did not receive intraarterial therapy, potentially diluting the treatment effect but reaffirming the pragmatic, real-world context. Overall, the statistical significance is robust, but some subgroup findings (especially for patients with low ASPECTS) remain uncertain. The degree of clinical meaningfulness (e.g., in absolute numbers needed to treat for functional independence) supports the adoption of the intervention in guideline practice, but real-world systems will need to ensure optimal logistics to replicate these results.
