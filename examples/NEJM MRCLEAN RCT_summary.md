## A Randomized Trial of Intraarterial Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke

---

## Aim of Study

The study aimed to assess whether intraarterial treatment plus usual care would be more effective than usual care alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation that could be treated within 6 hours after symptom onset.

---

## Study Design

This was a pragmatic, phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with open-label treatment assignments and blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE design). The trial was conducted at 16 centers in the Netherlands.

---

## Intervention

The intervention consisted of intraarterial treatment in addition to usual care (which could include intravenous alteplase). Intraarterial treatment could include intraarterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or both, at the discretion of the interventionist. Usual care alone, potentially including intravenous alteplase, was the control treatment.

## Number of Subjects

A total of 500 patients were enrolled: 233 were assigned to the intraarterial treatment plus usual care group, and 267 were assigned to the usual care alone (control) group.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

**Inclusion criteria:**
- Age 18 years or older, no upper age limit
- Acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion (distal intracranial carotid artery, middle cerebral artery [M1 or M2], or anterior cerebral artery [A1 or A2]) of the anterior circulation, confirmed by vessel imaging (CT angiography, MR angiography, or digital subtraction angiography).
- Initiation of intraarterial treatment possible within 6 hours after symptom onset
- NIHSS score of 2 or higher

**Exclusion criteria:**
- The complete list is specified in the protocol (not included verbatim in the main paper text), but included standard contraindications for intervention; the inclusion of certain conditions (e.g., extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion or dissection) was left to physician discretion.

## Primary Outcome

The primary outcome measure was the score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days, which is a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The principal analysis used ordinal logistic regression to estimate a common odds ratio (shift analysis) for a better mRS outcome.

---

## Secondary Outcome

Secondary outcomes included:
- NIHSS scores at 24 hours and at 5–7 days/discharge
- Barthel index at 90 days (measure of activities of daily living)
- EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at 90 days (measure of health-related quality of life)
- Several dichotomizations of the mRS (e.g., 0 or 1 vs 2–6; 0–2 vs 3–6; 0–3 vs 4–6)
- Imaging outcomes: arterial recanalization at 24 hours, final infarct volume at 3–9 days
- Safety endpoints: symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, new ischemic stroke in a different vascular territory, death, and procedure-related complications.

---

## Statistical Methods

- Primary analysis: Ordinal logistic regression for the mRS, adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (age, baseline NIHSS, time from onset to randomization, history of previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, occlusion site).
- Secondary analyses: Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, beta coefficients for continuous outcomes, and logistic regression for categorical outcomes.
- Subgroup analyses and shift analyses across the entire mRS range were performed.
- Adjustments for multiple stratification factors in randomization (medical center, planned use of intravenous alteplase, planned treatment method, stroke severity).

## Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics were well-matched between groups. There were no significant differences reported in key demographic or clinical variables (age, sex, baseline NIHSS, time from onset to randomization, comorbidities, occlusion location) between the intervention and control groups.

---

## Primary Outcome Results

There was a statistically significant shift in the distribution of mRS scores in favor of the intervention at 90 days. The adjusted common odds ratio for better outcome was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.30). The percentage of patients achieving functional independence (mRS 0–2) at 90 days was 32.6% in the intervention group versus 19.1% in the control group, an absolute difference of 13.5 percentage points (95% CI, 5.9 to 21.2; adjusted odds ratio 2.16, 95% CI 1.39–3.38).

---

## Secondary Outcome Results

All clinical and imaging secondary outcomes favored the intervention:
- NIHSS at 5–7 days: median 8 (intervention) vs 14 (control), adjusted beta −2.9 (95% CI, −4.3 to −1.5)
- Barthel index 19 or 20 (indicating no significant disability): 46% (intervention) vs 29.8% (control), adjusted odds ratio 2.1 (95% CI 1.4–3.2)
- EQ-5D: marginally higher in intervention (median 0.69 vs 0.66), small statistically significant difference only
- Imaging: 75.4% in the intervention group had no residual occlusion at 24 hours versus 32.9% in controls; median final infarct volume was smaller by 19 ml (95% CI 3–34) favoring the intervention.
- No significant difference in mortality or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.

## Analysis

This study demonstrates a statistically significant, and arguably clinically meaningful, benefit for intraarterial therapy in acute ischemic stroke with proximal anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours. The study uses an appropriate randomized controlled design, adequate sample size, robust statistical methodology (including adjustment for important covariates), and blinded outcome assessment. The broad inclusion criteria increase generalizability but also introduce substantial heterogeneity, including advanced age and those with poor baseline prognosis, which could dilute the treatment effect. However, subgroup analyses did not show heterogeneity of treatment effect by age or other key variables.

Several limitations are notable. The open-label treatment introduces some risk of performance and detection bias despite blinded outcome assessments. Not all patients received the allocated intervention (15.9% in the intervention arm did not actually undergo the procedure), though the intention-to-treat analysis preserves randomization integrity. A log of all screened patients was not maintained, so the degree of selection bias cannot be fully established. Not all secondary outcomes are equally clinically relevant; the difference in quality-of-life (EQ-5D) scores, while statistically significant, is of questionable clinical significance. While the manuscript claims safety parity, there was a numerically higher rate of new ischemic strokes in different territories in the intervention group, suggesting a procedural risk not fully explored in the discussion. Overall, the authors' main conclusions regarding efficacy and safety are justified, but nuances in procedural risk and limitations in generalizability (e.g., to those presenting outside 6 hours or with posterior circulation strokes) should be more clearly emphasized.
