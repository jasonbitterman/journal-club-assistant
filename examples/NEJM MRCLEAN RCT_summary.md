## Title of Study
A Randomized Trial of Intraarterial Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke.

## Aim of Study
To assess whether intraarterial treatment plus usual care is more effective than usual care alone in patients with a proximal arterial occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation that could be treated intraarterially within 6 hours after symptom onset.

## Study Design
Pragmatic, phase 3, multicenter randomized clinical trial with open-label treatment, involving randomized treatment-group assignments and blinded end-point evaluation.

## Intervention
Intraarterial treatment (intraarterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or both) in addition to usual care (which could include intravenous alteplase), compared with usual care alone (control). Method of intraarterial treatment (e.g., thrombolytic agent, mechanical thrombectomy technique) was at the discretion of the interventionist.

## Number of Subjects
- Intervention group: 233 subjects
- Control group: 267 subjects
Total: 500 subjects.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
- Inclusion: Patients 18 years or older (no upper age limit) with acute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation artery (distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 or M2 of the middle cerebral artery, or A1 or A2 of the anterior cerebral artery), confirmed by CT angiography, MRA, or DSA; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 2 or higher; possible to initiate intraarterial treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset. Inclusion of patients with additional extracranial internal-carotid-artery occlusion or dissection was at the physician's discretion.
- Exclusion: The full detailed criteria are referenced to the full protocol but are not exhaustively listed in the manuscript.

## Primary Outcome
The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days, a 7-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 6 = death); this is a categorical measure of functional outcome.

## Secondary Outcome
- NIHSS score at 24 hours and at 5 to 7 days (or discharge if earlier)
- Barthel Index (activities of daily living) at 90 days
- Health-related quality of life (EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire, EQ-5D) at 90 days
- Various dichotomizations of the mRS (e.g., 0–1 vs 2–6, 0–2 vs 3–6, 0–3 vs 4–6)
- Imaging: arterial recanalization at 24 hours (via CTA), final infarct volume at 5-7 days (noncontrast CT).

## Statistical Methods
Primary outcome was assessed with ordinal logistic regression (common odds ratio), adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (age, baseline NIHSS, time from stroke onset, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and occlusion location). Dichotomous and continuous secondary outcomes were analyzed with logistic or linear regression, adjusted for the same covariates. Subgroup analyses and intention-to-treat were used.

## Baseline Characteristics
No clinically relevant differences in baseline characteristics between groups; factors such as age, sex, risk factors including prior stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and NIHSS scores were well balanced (e.g., median age: 65.8 vs 65.7; male sex: 57.9% vs 58.8%; median NIHSS: 17 vs 18).

## Primary Outcome Results
- There was a significant shift in the mRS distribution in favor of the intervention: adjusted common odds ratio 1.67 (95% CI, 1.21–2.30).
- Functional independence (mRS 0–2 at 90 days) was achieved in 32.6% of the intervention group vs 19.1% of controls (absolute difference 13.5 percentage points; adjusted odds ratio 2.16, 95% CI 1.39–3.38).
- Median mRS was 3 (IQR 2–5) for intervention and 4 (IQR 3–5) for control.

## Secondary Outcome Results
- All secondary clinical and imaging outcomes favored intervention:
  - More recanalization/absence of residual occlusion at 24h: 75.4% (intervention) vs 32.9% (control)
  - Median NIHSS score at 5–7 days: 8 (IQR 2–17, intervention) vs 14 (IQR 7–18, control) — difference of 2.9 points (95% CI, 1.5–4.3) in favor of intervention
  - Barthel Index 19–20 at 90 days: 46.0% (intervention) vs 29.8% (control)
  - Median EQ-5D at 90 days: 0.69 (IQR 0.33–0.85, intervention) vs 0.66 (IQR 0.30–0.81, control)
  - Infarct volume lower by 19 ml (95% CI, 3–34) in intervention group
  - No significant difference in mortality or serious adverse event rate, but a higher rate of new ischemic stroke in a different territory in the intervention group (5.6% vs 0.4%).

## Analysis
The MR CLEAN trial was meticulously designed with robust methods including stratified randomization, blinded outcome assessment, and prespecified analytic plans. Baseline characteristics were well balanced, and the use of intention-to-treat analysis adds credibility to the validity of results. The primary and secondary outcome measures are standard, meaningful scales in stroke, and the statistical approach was appropriate. High rates of IV alteplase pretreatment in both arms mirror real-world acute care in many settings.

However, some issues may temper the external validity and interpretation of results. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, while generally broad, left significant physician discretion (e.g., for some extracranial carotid lesions), and detailed logs of screened/excluded patients were not maintained, which could bias the population studied. Nearly 8% of assigned patients in the intervention group did not undergo the intended procedure, and some crossover occurred. There was also a higher rate of new ischemic stroke in other vascular territories among the intervention group, complicating the safety profile. Though the functional improvement is statistically significant, the absolute difference in full independence (mRS 0-2) is modest, and some outcomes (such as quality of life or avoided disability) have confidence intervals that include clinically marginal values. Despite strong statistical findings, the actual clinical impact may be more nuanced for older and higher-risk stroke populations. Overall, while conclusions regarding efficacy and safety are largely supported by the data, some methodology and reporting limitations caution against broad generalization to all stroke patients or intervention techniques.
