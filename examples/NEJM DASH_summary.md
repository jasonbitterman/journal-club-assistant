## A Clinical Trial of the Effects of Dietary Patterns on Blood Pressure

## Aim of Study
To assess the effects of different dietary patterns—specifically, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or one enriched further with low-fat dairy foods and reduced saturated and total fat (“DASH combination diet”)—on blood pressure in adults with pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension.

## Study Design
Multicenter, randomized, controlled feeding trial (parallel-group), in which all subjects first completed a three-week run-in phase on a control diet before random assignment to one of three diets for eight weeks. Sodium intake and body weight were held constant.

## Intervention
Three dietary interventions:
1. Control diet: low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with fat content typical of the U.S. diet.
2. Fruits-and-vegetables diet: rich in fruits and vegetables, otherwise similar to control.
3. Combination (DASH) diet: rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and reduced in saturated and total fat.

## Number of Subjects
Total randomized: 459 adults.
- Control diet: 154 subjects
- Fruits-and-vegetables diet: 154 subjects
- Combination (DASH) diet: 151 subjects.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
### Inclusion:
- Age ≥22 years
- Systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg and diastolic 80–95 mm Hg (mean of six measurements at screening)
- Not using antihypertensive medication (or, if previously treated, met BP criteria after supervised withdrawal)
### Exclusion:
- Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
- Hyperlipidemia
- Cardiovascular event in the prior 6 months
- Chronic diseases that might interfere with participation
- Pregnancy or lactation
- Body mass index >35
- Use of medications affecting blood pressure
- Refusal to stop certain supplements
- Renal insufficiency
- Alcohol intake >14 drinks per week
The study aimed to recruit two-thirds minority subjects (primarily black Americans).

## Primary Outcome
Change in sitting diastolic blood pressure at rest (difference between baseline and end of intervention phase).

## Secondary Outcome
- Change in sitting systolic blood pressure at rest
- Changes in ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure.

## Statistical Methods
- Intention-to-treat analyses
- Two-way analysis of covariance, adjusted for clinical center
- Planned subgroup analyses by sex, minority status, and baseline hypertension
- Targeted to detect a 2 mm Hg difference with 85% power
- Significance set at P<0.025 with 97.5% confidence intervals to adjust for multiple comparisons.

## Baseline Characteristics
There were no meaningful or statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, weight, BMI, previous use of BP medication, or baseline blood pressures. Groups were well-matched on all reported demographics and clinical variables.

## Primary Outcome Results
- The combination diet reduced diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mm Hg more than the control diet (P<0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07).
- The combination diet reduced diastolic BP by 1.9 mm Hg more than the fruits-and-vegetables diet (P=0.002).
- Effects were most pronounced in hypertensive subjects: -5.5 mm Hg diastolic reduction compared with control (P<0.001).

## Secondary Outcome Results
- The combination diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 5.5 mm Hg more than the control diet (P<0.001) and by 2.7 mm Hg more than the fruits-and-vegetables diet (P=0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg more than control (P<0.001).
- Ambulatory BP reductions mirrored clinical BP results.
- The greatest reductions were observed in those with hypertension at baseline; also, effects were seen across sex, ethnicity, and hypertensive status, with minority subjects experiencing numerically greater reductions.

## Analysis
This study is methodologically rigorous, utilizing a randomized, controlled, multicenter feeding trial design with strong attention to compliance, dietary control, and matching for sodium and body weight. The intention-to-treat approach is appropriate and the use of subgroup analyses pre-specified. The reported baseline comparability across groups eliminates major concerns about allocation bias. Although the primary outcome (diastolic BP) did not achieve conventional significance for the fruits-and-vegetables-only diet, the combination DASH diet showed consistent, statistically robust effects. The effect sizes in hypertensive subjects are of clinical interest, though for the general population, the average reduction may be modest. The absence of differential loss to follow-up, excellent reported adherence, and completeness of outcome ascertainment strengthen the reliability of these findings.

However, the study's external validity is partially limited. The exclusion criteria (e.g., BMI>35, severe comorbidities, significant alcohol use) mean these results may not apply to broader clinical populations often encountered in hypertension management. Furthermore, its short duration prevents any direct conclusions about long-term adherence, sustained BP reduction, or downstream cardiovascular outcomes—points that the authors acknowledge but somewhat under-discuss in the implications. The feeding study context may also overestimate real-world effectiveness. There is also limited exploration of adverse events or tolerability beyond some gastrointestinal complaints. Overall, the conclusions about the DASH combination diet being efficacious for BP lowering in a controlled setting are well-supported, but extrapolation to public health effects and substitution for pharmacotherapy should be made cautiously, pending real-world and longer-term assessments.
