## A Clinical Trial of the Effects of Dietary Patterns on Blood Pressure

---

## Aim of Study

To assess the effects of different dietary patterns on blood pressure in adults, specifically focusing on dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), including a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with reduced saturated and total fat.

---

## Study Design

A multicenter, randomized, controlled feeding study (feeding trial) with parallel-group assignment. Subjects first completed a 3-week run-in period (all on control diet), then were randomly assigned for 8 weeks to one of three dietary patterns.

---

## Intervention

Three dietary patterns were tested:
1. Control diet: Low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average U.S. diet.
2. Fruits-and-vegetables diet: High in fruits and vegetables, otherwise similar to control.
3. Combination (DASH) diet: Rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, reduced in saturated and total fat, otherwise similar calorie and sodium content across all diets. All subjects' sodium intake and body weight kept constant.

## Number of Subjects

Total enrolled: 459 adults. 
Breakdown by group is not explicitly given, but as subjects were randomized in parallel to three groups, it is inferred to be roughly equal (approximately 153 per group).

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Adults aged 22 years or older
- Not on antihypertensive medication (or able to meet BP criteria after withdrawal)
- Average systolic BP <160 mm Hg and diastolic BP 80–95 mm Hg (mean of 6 measurements over 3 visits)

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Poorly controlled diabetes
- Hyperlipidemia
- Recent cardiovascular event (<6 months)
- Chronic diseases interfering with participation
- Body mass index >35
- Medications affecting BP
- Refusal to stop supplements/antacids containing magnesium or calcium
- Renal insufficiency
- Alcohol intake >14 drinks per week
- Pregnancy or lactation.

## Primary Outcome

Change in diastolic blood pressure at rest from baseline to follow-up (weeks 7 and 8 of intervention).

---

## Secondary Outcome

- Change in systolic blood pressure at rest
- Change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

---

## Statistical Methods

- Intention-to-treat analysis.
- Between-diet differences in BP changes tested by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
- Subgroup analyses according to sex, minority status, and baseline BP (hypertension defined as SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90).
- Power calculation: 456 subjects gives 85% power to detect a 2 mm Hg between-diet difference in diastolic BP with two-sided alpha = 0.025 (due to multiple comparisons adjustment).
- 97.5% confidence intervals applied to be consistent with multiple comparison adjustment.

---

## Baseline Characteristics

No substantial or clinically meaningful differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Demographically, the sample was heterogeneous: 49% women, 60% black, 37% with household income < $30,000/year; mean baseline BP: 131.3/84.7 mm Hg. Table 4 and text specify groups were well balanced by relevant demographics and baseline blood pressures.

---

## Primary Outcome Results

- The combination (DASH) diet reduced diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mm Hg more than the control diet (P<0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced diastolic BP by 1.1 mm Hg more than control (P=0.07).
- In hypertensive subjects (n=133), combination diet produced even larger reductions: 5.5 mm Hg lower than control (P<0.001).

---

## Secondary Outcome Results

- The combination diet reduced systolic BP by 5.5 mm Hg and diastolic by 3.0 mm Hg more than control.
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg and diastolic by 1.1 mm Hg more than control.
- Among hypertensives, combination diet reduced systolic by 11.4 mm Hg and diastolic by 5.5 mm Hg versus control.
- Ambulatory BP: Combination diet reduced mean 24-hr systolic by 4.5 mm Hg and diastolic by 2.7 mm Hg more than control (P<0.001 for both); fruits-and-vegetables diet also produced modestly significant reductions.

## Analysis

The paper’s conclusions regarding blood pressure reduction due to dietary patterns are generally well supported by the presented data, especially the greater effect of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy (combination diet) compared to control. The design as a controlled-feeding study in a demographically diverse sample, randomization after a run-in period, and intention-to-treat analyses enhance the validity of the results. Importantly, no significant baseline imbalances or group differences are described, and adherence appears excellent by multiple measures.

However, some important limitations should be emphasized. The study’s external validity is constrained because it was a feeding study; participants had little choice over food selection or procurement, and the trial was only 11 weeks in duration. Thus, adherence, sustainability, and long-term effects in real-world and self-selected settings remain unknown. Furthermore, strictly limiting sodium, body weight, and alcohol reduces confounding, but does not reflect typical practice where these variables might change. The authors do not address the potential for Hawthorne effect due to intense supervision. Clinically, the observed group mean BP reductions, while statistically significant, are moderate for nonhypertensive individuals. The practical impact for individuals with normal BP is less clear, even if population projections are made. Overall, while the internal validity of the trial is strong for the short-term, the clinical significance and generalizability to a broader, unsupervised population and long-term outcomes are not addressed—caution should be used in direct application to clinical or public health recommendations beyond the controlled study context.
