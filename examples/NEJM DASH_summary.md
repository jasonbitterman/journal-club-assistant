## Title of Study
A Clinical Trial of the Effects of Dietary Patterns on Blood Pressure.

## Aim of Study
To assess the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure, specifically evaluating whether diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and/or low-fat dairy products can lower blood pressure compared to a control diet.

## Study Design
Multicenter, randomized, controlled feeding trial involving three different dietary interventions over 11 weeks—starting with a three-week run-in phase (all subjects on a control diet), followed by an eight-week intervention phase with random assignment to one of three diet groups.

## Intervention
Three interventions:
1. Control diet (low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy, with typical US fat content)
2. Fruits-and-vegetables diet (high in fruits and vegetables)
3. Combination diet (high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy; reduced saturated and total fat).

## Number of Subjects
A total of 459 adults were randomized:
- Control diet: 154 subjects
- Fruits-and-vegetables diet: 154 subjects
- Combination diet: 151 subjects.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
**Inclusion:**  
- Adults ≥22 years old  
- Not taking antihypertensive medication, or able to meet BP criteria after withdrawal of medication  
- Systolic BP <160 mm Hg and diastolic BP 80–95 mm Hg (mean of six measurements during three screening visits)

**Exclusion:**  
- Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
- Hyperlipidemia
- Cardiovascular event within prior 6 months
- Chronic diseases interfering with participation
- Pregnancy or lactation
- BMI >35
- Use of medications affecting blood pressure
- Unwillingness to stop certain supplements
- Renal insufficiency
- Alcohol intake >14 drinks/week.

## Primary Outcome
Change in diastolic blood pressure at rest from baseline to end of intervention.

## Secondary Outcome
- Change in systolic blood pressure at rest
- Change in ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure
- Adverse effects and symptoms (such as gastrointestinal effects).

## Statistical Methods
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with adjustment for clinical center
- Two-tailed hypothesis testing, with P ≤ 0.025 considered statistically significant to account for multiple comparisons
- 97.5% confidence intervals reported
- Power calculation indicated 85% power to detect a 2 mm Hg difference in diastolic BP
- Analyses performed by intention-to-treat.

## Baseline Characteristics
There were no clinically or statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics among the three diet groups in terms of age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, weight, BMI, history of blood-pressure medication, or baseline blood pressure.

## Primary Outcome Results
- The combination diet reduced diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mm Hg more than the control diet (P ≤ 0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P = 0.07; not statistically significant).
- In hypertensive subjects (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg), the combination diet reduced diastolic BP by 5.5 mm Hg relative to control (P ≤ 0.001).

## Secondary Outcome Results
- The combination diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 5.5 mm Hg more than the control diet (P ≤ 0.001); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg more than control (P ≤ 0.001).
- For 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure: combination diet reduced systolic BP by 4.5 mm Hg and diastolic by 2.7 mm Hg compared with control; fruits-and-vegetables diet reductions were 3.1 mm Hg (systolic) and 2.1 mm Hg (diastolic) compared to control (all P ≤ 0.002).
- Rates of constipation were lower in the diet groups compared to control; otherwise, adverse effects were rare and similar between groups.

## Analysis
While the study is a well-powered, multicenter randomized feeding trial that effectively controls for confounding factors like weight, sodium intake, and medication use, some limitations are evident. The inclusion criteria exclude individuals with very high blood pressure, major comorbid conditions, and those with obesity (BMI >35), which could limit generalizability beyond relatively healthy, mild-to-moderate hypertensive adults. The exclusion of those unwilling or unable to strictly adhere to a research diet (with >95% self-reported adherence and high retention across all groups) also may not reflect real-world settings where dietary compliance is a major challenge. Furthermore, this was a tightly controlled, short-term feeding study; long-term sustainability, real-world efficacy, and cardiovascular event outcomes remain unassessed.

The statistical approach was rigorous, making appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons. Baseline characteristics were closely matched, mitigating selection bias. Intention-to-treat analysis strengthens the validity of findings. However, the clinical significance of the observed BP reductions, although statistically robust, should be interpreted in light of the artificial (high adherence, prepared meals) environment of the study. While the size of BP reductions in hypertensive subjects is notable and comparable to some antihypertensive drugs, the impact on long-term outcomes such as MI, stroke, or mortality cannot be extrapolated. Overall, while the authors do not grossly overstate their conclusions, the applicability of these findings to long-term, real-world cardiovascular risk reduction is not established by this study alone.
