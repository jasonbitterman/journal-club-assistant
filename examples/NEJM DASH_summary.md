## Aim of Study

To assess the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure in adults, specifically evaluating whether diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced saturated and total fat, can lower blood pressure compared to a typical American diet low in these components.

## Study Design

This was a multicenter, randomized, controlled feeding study (clinical trial). After a three-week run-in on a control diet, participants were randomly assigned to one of three diets for eight weeks: control, fruits-and-vegetables, or a combination diet. The study ensured controlled sodium intake and stable body weight.

## Intervention

The interventions were the assigned dietary patterns:
- Control diet: typical U.S. diet low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy, with typical fat content.
- Fruits-and-vegetables diet: similar to the control but much higher in fruits and vegetables.
- Combination diet: high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products; reduced saturated and total fat compared to the control. Sodium intake and calorie intake were controlled across all diets.

## Number of Subjects

459 adults enrolled were randomized into three groups:
- Control diet: 154 subjects
- Fruits-and-vegetables diet: 154 subjects
- Combination diet: 151 subjects.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion:
- Adults ≥22 years old

- Recent cardiovascular event (within 6 months)
- Chronic disease interfering with participation
- Pregnancy/lactation
- BMI >35
- Use of medications affecting BP
- Unwillingness to stop vitamin/mineral supplements or antacids with Mg/Ca
- Renal insufficiency
- Alcohol intake >14 drinks/week.

## Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was the change in resting diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of the 8-week intervention period.

---

## Secondary Outcome

Secondary outcomes included changes in systolic blood pressure, mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and laboratory measures such as urinary excretion of key nutrients. Subgroup analyses included effects in people with/without hypertension, sex, and minority status.

---

## Statistical Methods

- Primary analyses used intention-to-treat.
- Between-diet differences were tested using two-way analysis of variance, adjusting for clinical center.
- Adjustment for multiple comparisons: a significance threshold of P≤0.025 (two-tailed) was used with 97.5% confidence intervals.
- Subgroup analyses by sex, minority status, and baseline BP.
- Power calculations: the planned sample size provided 85% power to detect a 2 mm Hg difference in diastolic BP.

## Baseline Characteristics

There were no meaningful differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, weight, BMI, and previous antihypertensive medication use were all balanced across the control, fruits-and-vegetables, and combination diet groups. Mean baseline systolic and diastolic BPs were similar (approx. 131/85 mm Hg).

---

## Primary Outcome Results

- The combination diet reduced diastolic BP by 3.0 mm Hg more than the control diet (P≤0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced diastolic BP by 1.1 mm Hg more than control (P=0.07).
- Among 133 subjects with hypertension, the combination diet reduced diastolic BP by 5.5 mm Hg more than control (P≤0.001). In non-hypertensive subjects, the reduction was 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003).
- Differences were maintained after adjusting for weight and sodium excretion.

---

## Secondary Outcome Results

- The combination diet reduced systolic BP by 5.5 mm Hg more than the control (P≤0.001).
- The fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg more than control (P≤0.001).
- Among hypertensive subjects, the combination diet reduced systolic BP by 11.4 mm Hg (P≤0.001) and the fruits-and-vegetables diet by 7.2 mm Hg compared to control.
- Mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were also significantly reduced with both experimental diets compared to control.
- There were increased urinary potassium and magnesium in intervention groups, and GI symptoms (e.g., constipation) were least frequent in the combination group.

## Analysis

The DASH trial was rigorously conducted with strict control over diet adherence, sodium intake, and body weight, minimizing confounding and allowing for robust detection of real differences between dietary patterns. The randomization and large sample size, together with intention-to-treat analysis, strengthen internal validity. Baseline characteristics were well-matched, mitigating the risk of selection bias or residual confounding.

However, the results are primarily applicable to a controlled-feeding environment; participants had all food provided, and real-world adherence in a free-living population may be inferior, limiting external validity. The trial duration was short (8-week intervention over an 11-week total period), and it does not inform on long-term sustainability or cardiovascular outcomes. Excluding those with comorbidities, severe obesity, or very high blood pressure further limits generalizability. While the BP changes, especially in hypertensive subjects, are statistically robust and comparable to some antihypertensive medications, whether these moderate BP reductions translate into meaningful reductions in clinical events was not addressed. The study does not detail dropouts by group, but completion and adherence rates are reported to be high.

Overall, while the trial convincingly demonstrates that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy can lower BP under controlled conditions in an intermediate-risk population, it does not provide evidence regarding efficacy or feasibility in routine practice or over longer durations. The authors appropriately avoid overstating their conclusions, but the translation of these findings to broad population impact requires further study.
